# Teachable Review🚀: Is It the Best Choice for You?🤔

Hey there! Are you thinking about creating an online course but not sure where to start? Maybe you’ve heard of Teachable and want to know if it’s worth your time and money. 
Well, you’re in the right place! 

In this Teachable review, I’ll break it all down for you in simple English. We’ll look at what it is, how it works, the good stuff, the not-so-good stuff, and whether it’s the right fit for you in 2025. 
Let’s dive in!

## What Is Teachable?📚

Teachable is a platform that helps people make and sell online courses. It’s like a toolbox for anyone who wants to teach something—whether you’re a coach, a blogger, or just someone with a skill to share. 

You can build your course, set a price, and let students buy it all in one place. I’ve checked it out myself, and it’s pretty cool how it handles everything from videos to payments.
It started in 2013 as “Fedora” by a guy named Ankur Nagpal. He wanted a simple way for people to teach online. 

By 2015, it became Teachable, and now it’s huge—over 100,000 creators use it, and they’ve sold courses worth billions! Whether you’re teaching cooking, coding, or yoga, Teachable makes it possible without needing to be a tech wizard.

## How Does Teachable Work?🕵️

So, how does it actually work? It’s super straightforward. You sign up, pick a plan (there’s even a free one), and start building your course. 

You can upload videos, PDFs, quizzes—whatever you want your students to learn. Teachable gives you a website to host it all, so you don’t need your own. Then, you set your price, and students can buy and take your course right there.
I like how it’s all in one spot. You don’t have to worry about hosting videos somewhere else or figuring out payments—Teachable does that for you. 

Plus, it tracks how your course is doing, like how many people signed up or finished it. It’s like having a little assistant to keep things organized!

## Features That Stand Out🔥

Teachable has some cool features that make it shine. Here’s what I found awesome:

### 1. Course Builder

You can add videos, quizzes, or PDFs with a few clicks. I made a mini-course with a video and quiz—it was so smooth!

### 2. Payment Options

Students can pay with cards or PayPal, and you get paid fast. I tested it, and the money hit my account in days.

### 3. Student Tracking

See who’s taking your course and how far they’ve gotten. I loved watching my test students progress.

### 4. Customization

You can tweak colors and logos to match your style. My course looked like “me” after a quick edit.

### 5. Mobile-Friendly

Students can learn on phones or tablets. These features make teaching and learning feel easy and modern.

## Teachable Pricing💰

Let’s talk about money—how much does Teachable cost? As of March 2025, they’ve got four plans. Here’s the latest scoop in simple terms:

### Free Plan: $0/month. 

You can start with one course, but they take a $1 + 10% fee per sale. Good for testing the waters.

### Basic Plan: $69/month (or $49/month if paid yearly)

You get five courses, no $1 fee, but a 5% cut per sale.

### Pro Plan: $159/month (or $119/month yearly). Unlimited courses, no sale fees, and extras like certificates.

Business Plan: $249/month (or $199/month yearly). Everything in Pro, plus more users and fancy branding.

The Free Plan is great for beginners to try out, but the fees add up if you sell a lot. The Pro Plan is popular because it cuts those fees and gives you more tools. Prices might seem high, but you’re paying for a full system—no extra hosting costs! . 

## The Good Stuff👍: 7 Pros of Teachable

Now, let’s get into why people love Teachable. Here are seven big pros, written based on what I’ve found and tried:

### 1. Super Easy to Use

Teachable dashboard is like a breeze to figure out. You don’t need to be a tech pro—I set up a test course in under an hour! It’s drag-and-drop simple.

### 2. Affordable Way to Start

The Free Plan lets you dip your toes in without spending a dime. Even the Basic Plan at $39/month is cheaper than building your own site.

### 3. Handles Everything for You

From hosting videos to taking payments, Teachable does it all. I didn’t have to mess with extra tools—it’s a one-stop shop!

### 4. Makes Courses Look Pro

Your course gets a slick website that looks legit. Students I showed it to said it felt like a real school, not some random page.

### 5. Helps You Sell More

It’s got tools like coupons and upsells to boost sales. I tried a discount code, and it actually got more sign-ups!

### 6. Tracks Your Success

You can see how many students join or finish. I love checking those stats—it’s like a report card for my course.

### 7. Great Support Team

Stuck? Their support is fast and friendly. I emailed a question and got a clear answer in a day—pretty impressive!

These perks make Teachable a hit with creators. It’s built to save time and make teaching fun.

## The Not-So-Good Stuff👎: 3 Cons of Teachable

No tool’s perfect. Here are three cons I’ve noticed from using it and reading reviews:

### 1. Fees Can Add Up

On the Free and Basic plans, Teachable takes a cut of every sale—10% or 5%. If you sell a lot, that stings a bit.

### 2. No Built-In Blog

Want a blog to pull in students? Teachable doesn’t have one. You’d need to add something like DropInBlog, which is extra work.

### 3. Learning Curve for Extras

The basics are easy, but stuff like custom coding takes time to learn. I fumbled a bit with that part.

These aren’t deal-breakers, but they’re worth knowing before you jump in.

## Who’s Teachable Best For?🧐

Teachable isn’t for everyone, so who’s it perfect for? I’d say it’s awesome for:

### Beginners: 

If you’re new to online teaching, the Free Plan and simple setup are gold.

### Solo Creators: 

Coaches, bloggers, or freelancers can make courses without a big team.

### Small Businesses: 

It’s great for adding a course to your offerings without breaking the bank.

If you’re a huge company needing tons of fancy features, it might feel basic. But for most people starting out, it’s a sweet spot.

## How Does Teachable Stack Up?

The online course world’s growing fast—over 1 billion users are expected by 2028! Teachable to keep up by adding stuff like better analytics and community tools. 
I’ve seen competitors like Thinkific or Kajabi, and they’re good, too, but Teachable’s edge is its simplicity and one-stop setup. It’s not the cheapest or the fanciest, but it’s solid for most creators.

## 😎Tips to Get the Most Out of Teachable

Want to rock Teachable? Here’s what I learned:

**Start Free:** Test the Free Plan to see if it fits—no risk!

**Please keep it simple:** Short videos and clear lessons work best for me.

**Use Coupons:** Discounts pull in more students—I saw it firsthand.

**Check Stats:** Watch your analytics to tweak what’s not working.

**Ask for Help:** Their support is great—don’t hesitate to email them.

These tricks can turn a good course into a great one.

## Is Teachable Worth Your Money?💸

So, the big question is: should you use Teachable? I’d say yes if you want an easy, affordable way to start teaching online. 

The Free Plan’s perfect for trying it out, and the Pro Plan’s a sweet deal if you’re serious—no sale fees and unlimited courses for $119/month. 

It’s not flawless—fees and no blog are bummer—but it’s a solid choice for beginners and small creators.

If you’re scared of tech or tight on cash, Teachable is your friend. If you need super advanced stuff, maybe look elsewhere. For most people, though, it’s a winner.
